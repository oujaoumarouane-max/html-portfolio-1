<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>hy everyone my name is marouae and i am a digital skills /lego education teacher , I am a passionate educator specializing in LEGO Education and digital skills, with a strong love for robotics and technology. I currently teach robotics and STEAM-based
    learning to children, helping them explore innovation through hands-on projects and digital tools. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics and have also completed preparatory classes in Morocco (Classes Préparatoires Économiques Commerciales, option
    Technologie), where I developed a strong foundation in analytical thinking, business, and technology. My unique background allows me to bridge the gap between education, technology, and economic thinking—preparing students not just for the classroom,
    but for the future.</p>
